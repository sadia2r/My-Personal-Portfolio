  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <hr>
  <h4> Professional Summary</h4>
  <p>As I near the completion of my law degree, I have built a strong foundation in legal principles and enhanced my critical thinking skills. Being fluent in both English and Bengali has improved my communication and connection with people from different backgrounds, which also helps a lot in my tutoring and TEFL teaching. This work has shown me the importance of clear organisation as I balance university, a part-time job, tutoring and my own independent studies of front-end web development, with a particular interest in UX and UI design. All these experiences are preparing me for a career in freelancing, where I can use what I've learned in law, teaching, and tech altogether.</p>
